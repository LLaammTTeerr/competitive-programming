"""Where a package lives on Polygon — a file of its own, deliberately.

`uploading-to-polygon` has to remember one thing between runs: the Polygon
problem this package was uploaded to. The presence of that record is what
turns a second run into a *re-sync* of one problem rather than a second
problem with the same name, so it has to survive on disk.

**Why not a key in `problem.json`.** `problem.json` is matrix evidence:
`package_status._MATRIX_SOURCES` walks it, and `invocation.json` is stale the
moment anything in that walk is newer. Writing an upload record into it would
therefore make `tools.package_status` stop printing `complete` and
`tools.review_checks` emit a high `stale-matrix` — the two gates the upload
skill must pass *before* it writes. The first upload would report a failing
gate one phase after passing it, and every later run would fail the gate
permanently, over a package nothing had actually changed. The record is not
evidence about the matrix and must not be walked as if it were, so it lives
beside `problem.json` instead of inside it.

`polygon.json` is package data, not a byproduct: unlike `flags.json.lock` it
belongs in the problem repository's history, because it is the only record of
which Polygon problem a package owns.
